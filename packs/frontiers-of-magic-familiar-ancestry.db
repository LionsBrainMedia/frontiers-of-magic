{"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/familiar.svg","name":"Familiar (Ancestry)","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>The chumfolk might not recognize it, but you are a brave warrior! To support your adventuring, you&rsquo;ve enlisted the assistance of a chum&mdash;a buddy, an escort, and some days even a mount! (They call themselves &ldquo;master,&rdquo; but what are they master of?) This chum carries out the gruntwork of your adventure while you tend to the important dangers threatening the world.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<p>Accompany a master spellcaster, a warrior dabbling in magic, or a non-magical warrior you've developed a relationship with.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Interact with your chum's allies frequently or only when necessary.</li>\n<li>Develop a fascination and special bond with ordinary animals (the Unenlightened) around you.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Address your chum exclusively instead of you&hellip; How irritating&hellip;</li>\n<li>Make you the party's mascot or face.</li>\n<li>Expect you to sneak into danger they could just as well handle themselves.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>A familiar is a Tiny animal that has been transformed by a magic ritual. They might be marked by special patterns of spots or striations, a special light in the eyes, or a glowing nimbus.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Outside of magic academies and the biannual Gleaming Gathering, familiars don&rsquo;t often encounter each other. Familiar culture is small enough and familiars have such a remarkable memory that two familiars who meet have at least heard of each other, if not met before. They have learned to convey vital information to each other over quick conversations as their chums speed along their divergent paths.&nbsp;<br>The biannual Gleaming Gathering is held on the Dimension of Friendship, the same demiplane where pet cache pocket spaces are created. At the Gleaming Gathering, familiars trade stories, demonstrate newly found spells, exchange clues they&rsquo;ve found, and mentor younger familiars. Most chums never even notice that their familiars have left for this crucial event, but their adventures would surely fall apart without it.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Elves are often emotional and capricious, yet they hold high ideals close to their hearts. As such, many are chaotic good. They prefer deities who share their love of all things mystic and artistic. Desna and Shelyn are particular favorites, the former for her sense of wonder and the latter for her appreciation of artistry. Calistria is the most notorious of elven deities, as she represents many of the elven ideals taken to the extreme.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>Familiars are natural born adventurers! They partner with their chums and allies to defend the world against hidden threats.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>A familiar goes by two names: The name their chum bestows on them and their true name, used only in the Dimension of Friendship.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--color-underline-header);\">Familiar Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 6</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Tiny. Being Tiny comes with its own set of rules about space and reach. A Tiny PC can enter another creature&rsquo;s space, which is important because their melee Strikes typically have no reach, meaning the PC must enter a creature&rsquo;s space to attack it. Like other Tiny creatures, the PC doesn&rsquo;t automatically receive lesser cover from being in a larger creature&rsquo;s space, but circumstances might allow them to Take Cover in this instance. They can purchase weapons, armor, and other items for their size with the same statistics as normal gear, except that melee weapons have a reach of 0 for them (or a reach 5 feet shorter than normal if they have the reach trait). Remember to adjust the Bulk of items and the PC's Bulk limit for Tiny size.<br>A Tiny PC weighs so little and takes up so little Bulk that it wouldn't be a space issue to hitch a ride in a sack, on a shoulder, or otherwise be carried by a fellow PC. However, this requires a tremendous amount of coordination to ensure the Tiny PC doesn&rsquo;t get in the way, or the two PCs don&rsquo;t jostle each other into losing actions. As a result, for most parties, this tactic is less favorable than the Tiny PC just using their own mount. If a Tiny PC rides along with another PC or similar non-minion intelligent creature, roll both their initiatives and use the lower of the two results. The two PCs act in either order on the same initiative count. While traveling in this way, the PCs each gain two actions at the start of their turns, instead of three, since the larger PC spends one action keeping the smaller one balanced on their back, and the Tiny PC spends one action maintaining their grip.</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 20 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts</strong> Dexterity; either Intelligence or Wisdom as specified in your Heritage; Free</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Flaw</strong> Strength</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common and one of: Abyssal, Aquan, Auran, Celestial, Daemonic, Draconic, Infernal, Protean, Requian, Utopian.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive). Choose from any of the above and any other languages to which you have access (such as the languages prevalent in your region).</p>\n<p><strong>Senses</strong> Low-Light Vision</p>\n<p><strong>Chum </strong>You gain a chum. Choose Tiny, Small, or Medium for your chum's size. Your chum has the minion trait (although most familiars choose to never use that word), and a Speed of 25 feet. Choose bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, and choose melee or ranged. Your chum gains an attack with these traits (and a range of 30 feet if you chose ranged) that deals 1d4 damage of the chosen type. Your chum's proficiency with any of their attacks matches your proficiency with your class DC or spell DC (whichever is higher) and uses your key ability score. If you have potency runes or striking runes on your handwraps of mighty blows, this attack gains these benefits, as well. Your chum can speak Common and one other language you do. Your chum's save modifiers and AC are equal to yours before applying circumstance or status bonuses or penalties. Their Perception, Acrobatics, and Stealth modifiers are equal to your level plus your Charisma or spellcasting ability modifier (whichever is higher), and for other skills you're trained in, their modifier is equal to your level.</p>\n<p>Your chum gets 8 Hit Points for each of your levels. You can communicate empathically with your chum as long as they're within 1 mile of you, sharing emotions.</p>\n<p>If your chum dies, you can recruit a new chum after 1 week of mourning in the Dimension of Friendship.</p>"},"source":{"value":"Frontiers of Magic"},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":"elf","schema":{"version":0.794,"lastMigration":null},"hp":6,"size":"tiny","reach":0,"speed":20,"boosts":{"0":{"value":["dex"]},"1":{"value":["int","wis"]},"2":{"value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]}},"flaws":{"0":{"value":["str"]}},"languages":{"value":["common","requian"],"custom":"one of: Abyssal, Aquan, Auran, Celestial, Daemonic, Draconic, Infernal, Protean, Requian, Utopian"},"additionalLanguages":{"count":0,"value":["abyssal","aquan","auran","celestial","daemonic","draconic","infernal","protean","requian","utopian"],"custom":""},"items":{},"vision":"lowLightVision"},"type":"ancestry","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.ancestries.PgKmsA2aKdbLU6O0"}},"effects":[],"ownership":{"default":0,"zORMNp1HehVujHdC":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.2.6","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1668184390768,"modifiedTime":1668185258055,"lastModifiedBy":"zORMNp1HehVujHdC"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"9VCgXHae5wQXeicB"}
